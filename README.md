# docker-piwik-linode
This `docker-compose.yml` installs Piwik.


# Environments
The root `docker-compose.yml` is the base of the environment specific configurations, so it does not links containers, nor creates the volumes.

## Development
Exposes ports 980 and 9443, so it should not conflict with your local servers.
`docker-compose -f ./environments/development/docker-compose.yml up -d`

### .env

## Production
Exposes ports 80 and 443.

This file defines the `MariaDB` credentials.
